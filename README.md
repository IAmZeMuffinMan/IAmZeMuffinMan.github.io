## What are some of my interests, Hobbies, Prior Education?
I have a interest of gaming, lego and piano. I do some ocassional video editing for projects here and there and I have a massive collection of lego. I attended a a accelerated learning elementry (Think of it as AP, but for elementry students.) called New Horizions. I went to DisneyWorld when I was in grade two for Spring break, and I still have an autograph book from all of the characters.I have many lego sets living in my room, my crown achivement being the [Space_Shuttle_Discovery] (https://www.lego.com/en-ca/product/nasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283). Past that, I don't have much to say.

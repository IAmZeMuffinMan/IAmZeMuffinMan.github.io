    <h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">What is the Internet?</h2>
    <p style="color : black ; text-align:left"> There are three tiers of Internet. There is Tier one, Tier two, and Tier three. Tier one are massive fibre optic cables that span the world and are operated by big companies. Tier one internet connections have to go though something called an internet exhange point. These are where these cables connect to one another. These are neutrally owned, sometimes non-profit orginizations to try and unify the Internet backbone. The Internet Exchange Points are neutrally owned, so that theoreticly the corperations can't prioritize their own internet over their competiors. tier two is regional routers, and tier three are households/buisnesses.</p>

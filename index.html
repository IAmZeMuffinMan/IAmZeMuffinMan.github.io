<p style="color : black ; text-align:left"> There are three tiers of Internet. There is Tier one, Tier two, and Tier three. Tier one are massive fibre optic cables that span the world and are operated by big companies. Tier one internet connections have to go though something called an internet exhange point. These are where these cables connect to one another. These are neutrally owned, sometimes non-profit orginizations to try and unify the Internet backbone. The Internet Exchange Points are neutrally owned, so that theoreticly the corperations can't prioritize their own internet over their competiors. tier two is regional routers, and tier three are households/buisnesses.</p>

<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">How is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to facilitate client server interactions?</h2>
<p>HTTP requests and responds between the client and server. A client requests something from the server though a HTTP request, and the server responds though an HTTP response. HTTP is essentially a middleman that takes your request from something like google, and reformats it to something that Google knows what to do with. </p>
<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">What is HTTP and how does it differ from HTTPS?</h2>
<p>HTTP is a protocol used to access data on the world wide web. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTPS is HTTP with encrypting and verification. HTTPS uses TLS(SSL) to digitally sign HTTP push and pull requests, making it more secure.</p>

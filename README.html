<p style="color : black ; text-align:left"> There are three tiers of Internet. There is Tier one, Tier two, and Tier three. Tier one are massive fibre optic cables that span the world and are operated by big companies. Tier one internet connections have to go though something called an internet exhange point. These are where these cables connect to one another. These are neutrally owned, sometimes non-profit orginizations to try and unify the Internet backbone. The Internet Exchange Points are neutrally owned, so that theoreticly the corperations can't prioritize their own internet over their competiors. tier two is regional routers, and tier three are households/buisnesses.</p>

<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center"> What is hypertext?</h2>
<p> Hypertext is a software that links topics on your screen to relevant information and pictures</p>
<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">How does "the web" relate to the internet?</h2>
<p>The internet links your computer to other computers as a way of transferring content. The web is what lets you use that content or upload your own.</p>
<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">How is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to facilitate client server interactions?</h2>
<p>HTTP requests and responds between the client and server. A client requests something from the server though a HTTP request, and the server responds though an HTTP response. HTTP is essentially a middleman that takes your request from something like google, and reformats it to something that Google knows what to do with. </p>
<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">What is HTTP and how does it differ from HTTPS?</h2>
<p>HTTP is a protocol used to access data on the world wide web. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTPS is HTTP with encrypting and verification. HTTPS uses TLS(SSL) to digitally sign HTTP push and pull requests, making it more secure.</p>

<p>Markup languages are used to annotate text, images, youtube videos and other content to display in a web browser.</p>
<h2 style="color :rgba(189, 47, 11, 0.664); text-align:center">Compare and contrast markup languages and scripting languages</h2>
<p>Markup languages are used to present data, i.e show these names in a bullet list. Scripting languages are used to take more than one program and generate data from all of those programs. Think scripting languages as the interpeters of all of these programs and these interpeters as  </p>

<p>What are these different markup languages?
    <ol>
        <li>Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a standard for defining markup languages. It is a meta-language that defines a set of rules for defining other languages. It is a standard for defining markup languages. It is a meta-language that defines a set of rules for defining other languages.
        <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language, and is designed to store and transport language between different sites. For example, you can use XML to store data about a person, and then transport that data from one site to another, without losing any information. 
        <li>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is a cross between HTML and XML. XHTML is almost identical to HTML, but it is more strict about the syntax of the code. This means that it is easier to write programs that can read XHTML code. 
        <li>Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML)is used to make dynamic or animated webpages. For example, you can use XHTML to create a webpage that has a moving image, or a moving text box. .
        <li>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
    </ol>
So, whats the relation?
Standered generilized Markup language is a standered that all of the above languages either use or modify to some extent. XML is a more flexible version of HTML, XHTML is a more strict version of HTML, DHTML is a more dynamic version of HTML, and Markdown is a more lightweight version of HTML.

<p> I have a interest of gaming, lego and piano. I do some ocassional video editing for projects here and there and I have a massive collection of lego. I attended a acellerated learning elementry (Think of it as AP, but for elementry students.) called New Horizions.
